                <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;" id="p1"> It was the first winter
                    sport to be included in the Olympic Games, with its introduction occurring at the 1908 Olympics
                    in London. The Olympic disciplines are men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, and ice dance; the four
                    individual disciplines are also combined into a team event, which was first included in the Winter Olympics in
                    2014. The
                    non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating, Theater on Ice, and four skating. From intermediate
                    through
                    senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs , which,
                    depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals,
                    and other
                    elements or moves.</p>
                <p>The sport is also associated with show business. Major competitions generally conclude with exhibition galas, in
                    which
                    the top skaters from each discipline perform non-competitive programs. Many skaters, both during and after their
                    competitive careers, also skate in ice shows, which run during the competitive season and the off-season. </p>

                <p id="p2"> The ISU is the governing body for international competitions in figure skating, including the World Championships and
                the figure skating events at the Winter Olympic Games. Medals are awarded for overall results; the standard medals are
                gold for first place, silver for second, and bronze for third place. U.S. Figure Skating also awards pewter medals for
                fourth-place finishers in national events. Additionally, at the World, European, Four Continents, and World Junior
                Championships, the ISU awards small medals for segment results (short and free program) (Since 2009). A medal is
                generally attributed to only one country, even if a partnership is composed of skaters with different nationalities. A
                notable exception was the pair skating partnership between Ludowika Eilers and Walter Jakobsson; their 1910–11 medals
                were attributed to both Germany and Finland.[68] Beyond the early 20th century, no skaters have been allowed to
                represent two countries in the same competition.
                
                In singles and pairs figure skating competition, competitors perform two programs: the short program, in which they
                complete a set of required elements consisting of jumps, spins and steps; and the free skate, also known as the long
                program, in which they have a slightly wider choice of elements. Under both the 6.0 system and the ISU Judging System,
                the judges consider the "complete package" when evaluating performances, i.e. the best jumper is not always placed first
                if the judges consider the difference in jumping execution to be outweighed by another skater's speed, spins,
                presentation, etc.[69][70]
                
                Ice dance competitions formerly consisted of three phases: one or more compulsory dances; an original dance to a
                ballroom rhythm that was designated annually; and a free dance to music of the skaters' own choice. Beginning in the
                2010–11 season, the compulsory and original dances were merged into the short dance, which itself was renamed the rhythm
                dance in June 2018, before the 2018–19 season.</p>

                <h2> <center>Judging System</center> </h2>
                <p id="p3"> n 2004, in response to the judging controversy during the 2002 Winter Olympics, the ISU adopted the International
                Judging System (IJS), which became mandatory at all international competitions in 2006, including the 2006 Winter
                Olympics. The new system is sometimes informally referred to as the Code of Points, however, the ISU has never used the
                term to describe their system in any of their official communications.
                
                Under the IJS, points are awarded individually for each skating element, and the sum of these points is the total
                element score (TES). Competitive programs are constrained to include a set number of elements. Each element is judged
                first by a technical specialist who identifies the specific element and determines its base value. This is done using
                instant replay video to verify features that distinguish different elements; e.g. the exact foot position at take-off
                and landing of a jump. A panel of nine judges then each award a mark for the quality and execution of the element. This
                mark, called the grade of execution (GOE), is an integer with a minimum value of −5 and a maximum value of +5.[40] The
                GOE mark is then translated into another value by using the table of values in ISU rule 322.<br>  The GOE value from the nine
                judges is then processed with a computerized random selection of nine judges, the highest and lowest values are then
                discarded, and finally the average of the remaining seven is calculated. This average value is then added to (or
                subtracted from) the base value to determine the total value for the element.[74]
                
                Note: The IJS previously used a GOE scale of −3 to +3[75] but this was changed for the 2018–19 season and is in the
                early stages of being tested in competitions.
                
                The program components score (PCS) awards points to holistic aspects of a program or other nuances that are not rewarded
                in the total element score. The components are:
                
                Composition : This evaluates how the program is designed in relation to the music; how are the different elements
                connected; how is the available space used; how does the choreography reflect musical phrase and form?
                Presentation: This evaluates how the program is performed; what does the skater express and project; what energy is
                created; what is the musical sensitivity and timing; for Pair, Ice Dance and Synchronized skating is the skating
                appropriately synchronized and showing awareness of space?
                Skating skills: This mark assesses the skater's command of the blade over the ice, including the ability to skate with
                power and ease. The judges look at variety and clarity of edges, balance, body control, turns, steps, flow, power and
                speed.[76][77]
                A detailed description of each component is given in ISU rule 322.2. Judges award each component a raw mark from 0 to 10
                in increments of 0.25, with a mark of 5 being defined as "average". For each separate component, the raw marks are then
                selected, trimmed, and averaged in a manner akin to determining a grade of execution. The trimmed mean scores are then
                translated into a factored mark by multiplying by a factor that depends on the discipline, competition segment, and
                level. Then the five (or four) factored marks are added to give the final PCS score.
                
                The total element score and the program components score are added to give the total score for a competition segment
                (TSS). A skater's final placement is determined by the total of their scores in all segments of a competition. No
                ordinal rankings are used to determine the final results.</p>
